      This is a website without a purpose beyond teaching me how to make a website for now. Perhaps in the future it will look like <a target="_blank" rel="noopender" href="https://levonbiss.com/">this</a>.
      For now it will remain as this <em>very sad</em> HTML only site.

      Something for those who yearn for the websites of the early 2000's.
